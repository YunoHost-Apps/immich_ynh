🛠️ Upstream Immich repository: <https://github.com/immich-app/immich>

Pull request are welcome and should target the [`testing` branch](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/immich_ynh/tree/testing).

The `testing` branch can be tested using:
```
# fresh install:
sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/immich_ynh/tree/testing

# upgrade an existing install:
sudo yunohost app upgrade immich -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/immich_ynh/tree/testing
```

You can also switch to the testing branch to update from testing by default (as same as for APT when you chose to use a testing repos) with this command:
```bash
sudo yunohost app setting immich upgrade_channel -v testing
```
